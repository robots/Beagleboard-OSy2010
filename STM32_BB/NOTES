can_controller:

- Most functions are either ISR or called from ISR, thus all operations
	inside are atomic. (no interrupt nesting)
- there is a major bug in the HW, resulting in bogus interrupts once
	error state is detected. There is no other way to reset this state, than
	to issue Peripheral reset. (purpose of CANController_HW_Reinit) 
- if the error stat is still present, it will cause avalanche of interrupts
	(needs fix :-) (this state also implies that there is some HW error, which
	needs higher forces to fix it)


spi_slave:
- DMA callbacks need to be written efficiently not to stall the interrupt
	handling too much. (when DMA_CB_ISR == 1)
